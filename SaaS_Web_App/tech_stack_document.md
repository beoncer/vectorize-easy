# Tech Stack Document for tovector.ai

This document explains the technologies chosen for tovector.ai in an easily understandable way. Each section details how these technologies work together to create a smooth, secure, and efficient experience for small and mid-sized businesses in the design and printing industry.

## Frontend Technologies

We have built the user interface with simplicity and speed in mind. Here are the front-end technologies used:

- **Next.js**: A modern framework that helps in building fast, SEO-friendly, and responsive web pages. It makes navigating between pages smooth and efficient.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first styling tool that allows rapid and consistent styling of the app. It ensures that the look and feel remain minimalistic, with a clean white background, black text in 'Fixel Display' font, and red accents as needed.
- **TypeScript**: Provides strong typing, which minimizes bugs and makes the code easier to maintain and scale over time.
- **Shadcn UI**: A collection of pre-built UI components that speed up development and ensure a consistent user experience across the site.

These choices enhance user experience by ensuring that the interface is fast, responsive, visually appealing, and easy to navigate whether viewed on mobile or desktop devices.

## Backend Technologies

The backend of the platform manages data, user accounts, and image processing. Below are the primary backend technologies in use:

- **Supabase**: Acts as our main database and storage solution. It stores image metadata, user information, transaction records, and more.
  - Supabase Storage is used for saving uploaded images and vectorized results with strict retention policies to manage file sizes and privacy.
  - Supabase Database is protected by Row-Level Security (RLS) to ensure that users see only their own data.
- **Clerk Auth**: Handles user authentication securely, ensuring that only valid users access personal data and actions such as image uploads or downloads.
- **Stripe**: Powers the payment section by processing one-time credit purchases securely. It also manages VAT details and handles redirection back to our system after payment, updating user credit balances in Supabase.
- **OpenAI** (for future AI-driven features): Although currently not active, its integration is planned for AI-enhancements in image preview and vectorization down the line.

These components work together seamlessly. User actions like image uploads, previews, and vectorizations involve validating data, securely storing images, and managing user credits for each action.

## Infrastructure and Deployment

Our infrastructure choices ensure that the platform is reliable, scalable, and simple to deploy:

- **Hosting Platform**: The project is set up using modern deployment platforms (e.g., Vercel). Tools like V0 by Vercel help build AI-powered frontend components following modern design patterns.
- **Version Control**: Git is used as the version control system with repositories hosted on GitHub for transparency and collaborative development.
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automated testing and deployment pipelines ensure that updates are rolled out smoothly. This adds reliability and quick recovery if issues are ever found.
- **Project Structure**: The project uses a well-organized folder structure (as shown in the CodeGuide Starter Pro template) which separates API routes, components, hooks, utilities, and styles. This structure aids both current and future developers in quickly understanding and working on the codebase.

These measures contribute to a robust deployment process and ensure the system can grow and adapt with increased user demand.

## Third-Party Integrations

Several external services enhance tovector.ai’s functionality and overall performance. Here are the key third-party integrations:

- **Stripe**:
  - Handles all aspects of payment processing, including credit purchases and VAT calculations.
  - Manages secure checkout sessions, redirects, and post-payment user credit updates.
- **Clerk Auth**: Secures user authentication, managing both sign-up and login flows, which keeps personal data safe and compliant.
- **OpenAI**:
  - Planned for future integration to add AI-driven features such as advanced preview generation and more accurate vectorization.
- **VAT Validation Tools** (e.g., VIES or a VAT API like vatstack.com): Ensure proper VAT handling and compliance for EU customers.

These integrations add specialized functionality, reducing the need to build these features from scratch, and ensuring that the overall system is both secure and scalable.

## Security and Performance Considerations

Security and performance are crucial to ensure a safe and efficient user experience. Here’s what we have in place:

- **Security Measures**:
  - User authentication and authorization are managed securely with Clerk Auth, so sensitive account information is protected.
  - Supabase is configured with Row-Level Security (RLS) to ensure that users access only their own data.
  - All data in transit is encrypted using HTTPS, while sensitive data at rest is encrypted as well.
  - Stripe’s payments are secure, with sensitive payment details handled by Stripe directly.
- **Performance Optimizations**:
  - Next.js offers Server-Side Rendering and static site generation for fast page loads and improved SEO.
  - Tailwind CSS and Shadcn UI improve both aesthetics and responsiveness, ensuring a seamless experience on any device.
  - Automated backups and data retention policies (managed via Supabase and custom scripts) help mitigate data loss, ensuring high system reliability.

These security and performance considerations provide both peace of mind and a smooth, uninterrupted user experience on the platform.

## Conclusion and Overall Tech Stack Summary

tovector.ai is built with a balanced set of modern technologies aimed at making image vectorization simple, efficient, and secure for small business owners in the design and printing industry. In summary:

- **Frontend**: Uses Next.js, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, and Shadcn UI to deliver a fast, responsive, and aesthetic user experience.
- **Backend**: Relies on Supabase for data storage and operations, Clerk Auth for secure user authentication, and Stripe for payment processing, ensuring smooth and secure interactions.
- **Infrastructure**: Adopts modern hosting, automated deployment pipelines, and a clear project structure that supports reliability and scalability.
- **Integrations**: Enhances functionality with services like Stripe for payments, Clerk Auth for security, and (in the future) OpenAI for AI-driven improvements.
- **Security & Performance**: Prioritizes user data protection using encryption and RLS while ensuring fast, responsive interfaces with server-side optimizations and pre-planned backup strategies.

This tech stack aligns with our goal of providing a seamless, minimalistic, and efficient platform that is not only attractive to users but also robust enough to support essential functionalities such as image processing, credit management, and detailed reporting.

With this stack, tovector.ai is well-equipped to grow and evolve, meeting both today’s needs and future enhancements with confidence.
