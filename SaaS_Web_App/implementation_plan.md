# Implementation plan

## Phase 1: Environment Setup

1. Install Node.js and verify installation by running `node -v` (**Tech Stack: Frontend**).
2. Create a new Next.js project with Next.js 14 to meet our requirements. Use `npx create-next-app@latest --typescript` and then update package.json to explicitly use "next": "14.x" (**Tech Stack: Frontend**; note: ensure usage of Next.js 14 for compatibility with current AI coding tools and LLM models).
3. Install Tailwind CSS following the official Tailwind setup for Next.js. Create and configure `tailwind.config.js` at the project root and update `/styles/globals.css` accordingly (**Tech Stack: Frontend**).
4. Install Shadcn UI components as per the integration guide (add to project dependencies) and configure them within `/components/ui/` (**Tech Stack: Frontend**).
5. Initialize a new Git repository and commit the initial project setup (**Project Overview: Core Setup**).
6. Set up environment variables by creating an `.env.local` file in the project root. Add keys for Supabase (e.g., SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_ANON_KEY) and Clerk Auth (e.g., CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY) as provided by your accounts (**Data Handling and Compliance**).
7. **Validation**: Run `npm run dev` and visit http://localhost:3000 to ensure the basic Next.js setup is working.

## Phase 2: Frontend Development

8. Create a custom header component at `/components/Header.tsx` with a minimalistic design, using white background, black text, red accents, and the “Fixel Display” font. Include the tovector.ai logo and navigation buttons (Log In/Get Started) (**Design Preferences**).
9. Integrate Clerk Auth by adding a login button in the header that redirects users to the authentication flow (**Core Features: Secure user accounts**).
10. Develop the Home page at `/pages/index.tsx` featuring the image uploader UI, feedback section, and a call-to-action "Ready to transform your images?" section (**Core Features: Home Page, Project Overview**).
11. Create the Image Uploader component at `/components/ImageUploader.tsx` with support for PNG/JPG files (max file size 35MB), ensuring client-side validation for file size and pixel count limit of 33,554,432 pixels. Display a resize notification if the image is too big (**Core Features: Image uploader, Data Handling**).
12. **Validation**: Manually test image uploads in development to ensure validations are enforced.
13. Create `/pages/edit.tsx` to serve as the image editor popup page. Ensure it displays after an image upload, incorporating the uploaded image, and showing appropriate buttons: for logged-out users (“Sign Up and Get 1 Free Preview”) and for logged-in users (“Preview (0.2 credits)” and “Vectorize (1 credit)”) (**Core Features: Image uploader flow**).
14. Develop the `/pages/preview.tsx` page to display the uploaded image along with a "Vectorize (1 credit)" button (**Core Features: /preview page**).
15. Develop the `/pages/vectorize.tsx` page to show the vectorized result with a download dropdown for formats: SVG, PDF, EPS, DXF, PNG (**Core Features: /vectorize page**).
16. Create additional static pages: `/pages/examples.tsx`, `/pages/pricing.tsx`, `/pages/faq.tsx`, and `/pages/support.tsx`, ensuring each reflects project specifications (e.g., examples with before/after samples, pricing details, FAQ with 5 Q&A, and a support contact form) (**Core Features: Pages**).
17. Implement the Sales Analytics Dashboard for admins at `/pages/admin/dashboard.tsx`. Integrate charts for Total Conversions (line chart), Credit Usage Trends (line chart), Revenue Figures (bar chart), User Activity (area chart), Conversion Rate (funnel chart), and Download Format Preferences (pie chart) using a chart library (**Core Features: Sales analytics dashboard**).
18. Build reporting tools within the admin dashboard allowing CSV, PDF, XLSX, and JSON exports and incorporate filters (date range, action type, download format, user role, and credit usage threshold) (**Core Features: Reporting tools**).
19. **Validation**: Use visual testing (browser and responsive mode) to verify that pages load properly and design adheres to minimalistic, responsive design guidelines.

## Phase 3: Backend Development

20. Set up a Supabase project and configure it with necessary environment variables (SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_ANON_KEY) in `.env.local` (**Tech Stack: Backend & Storage**).
21. In the Supabase dashboard, create tables for users, uploads, vector_results, transactions, and sales_analytics, ensuring the proper schema for each (e.g., image metadata, credit credits, timestamps) (**Data Handling and Compliance**).
22. Establish Supabase Row-Level Security (RLS) policies for each table to ensure data access follows compliance needs (**Data Handling and Compliance**).
23. Integrate Clerk Auth with Supabase to manage user registration and authentication – store minimal user profile data and ensure data retention policies (active accounts and 30 days after deletion) are documented (**Core Features: Secure user accounts**).
24. Create an API route for image uploads at `/pages/api/upload.ts` to handle file uploads to Supabase storage. Include logic to validate file type, size (max 35MB), and pixel count (**Core Features: Image uploader**).
25. Create an API route for image preview at `/pages/api/preview.ts` that retrieves the uploaded image and prepares it for display (**Core Features: /preview page**).
26. Create an API route for vectorization at `/pages/api/vectorize.ts` which calls the external service at https://vectorizer.ai/api#quickstart. Ensure proper error handling and response transformation (**Core Features: /vectorize page**).
27. Create an API route for handling Stripe payments at `/pages/api/stripe.ts`. Implement logic for one-time credit purchase, including handling company name, VAT Address, and VAT Number. Integrate VAT logic for EU customers (**Core Features: Stripe Integration**).
28. Develop the `/pages/api/confirmation.ts` endpoint to fetch server-side data for the custom confirmation page after payment confirmation (**Core Features: /confirmation page**).
29. Implement server-side routines (or scheduled functions within Supabase Edge Functions if available) for data retention – delete images after 24 hours, transaction records after 7 years, and user logs after 1 year (**Data Handling and Compliance**).
30. **Validation**: Use tools like Postman or curl to test each API endpoint, verifying proper responses and error handling.

## Phase 4: Integration

31. Connect the frontend Image Uploader component to `/pages/api/upload.ts` via API calls using fetch or Axios. Ensure the uploaded image is stored in Supabase storage and its metadata recorded in the database (**Core Features: Integration of image uploader**).
32. Integrate the preview and vectorize buttons on the frontend to invoke `/pages/api/preview.ts` and `/pages/api/vectorize.ts`, respectively, and handle responses to display proper UI feedback (**Core Features: Workflow integration**).
33. Configure Clerk Auth on both frontend and API routes to secure endpoints and protect user data, ensuring that logged-in state is verified before credit-based actions are allowed (**Core Features: Secure user accounts**).
34. Connect the Stripe payment flow from the pricing page to the `/pages/api/stripe.ts` endpoint, and then redirect users to `/confirmation` after successful payments (**Core Features: Stripe Integration**).
35. Validate end-to-end flows: upload an image, test preview functionality, perform vectorization, and process a payment using the implemented API endpoints (**Validation: End-to-End Workflow Testing**).

## Phase 5: Deployment

36. Prepare the project for deployment by ensuring all environment variables are correctly configured in Vercel (use Vercel’s project settings for NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL, NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY, CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY, etc.) (**Tech Stack: Deployment**).
37. Deploy the Next.js frontend to Vercel using the V0 by Vercel service. Commit all changes to the repository and push to GitHub (or another Git provider) as required (**Deployment: Vercel**).
38. Verify that the deployed site is accessible and that all public pages (Home, Examples, Pricing, FAQ, Support) render correctly (**Validation: Deployment Smoke Test**).
39. Ensure Supabase backend remains connected by testing the image upload and API endpoints in production mode (**Validation: Backend Integration Test**).
40. Set up monitoring and logging for both frontend and backend services to capture errors and user activity, ensuring compliance with data retention and GDPR requirements (**Data Handling and Compliance**).
41. **Validation**: Run final end-to-end tests in the production environment to ensure all user flows work seamlessly, including authentication, image processing, and payment transactions.
